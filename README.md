# FIRST-TRY

This is my first try on GitHub.

I have a basic understanding of Python, and I made a simple calculator program to practice input, conditions, and basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

I am still a beginner in coding , so this project is mainly for learning and experimenting rather than showing something advanced.

## What I Made

A simple **Python calculator** that:
- Takes two numbers as input
- Lets the user choose an operation
- Performs:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
  - Floor division
- Runs in the **terminal**

## MY CONFUSION 

When I first created this repository, I thought that:
> “If I make a GitHub repository, the code will automatically run from the repo link.”

Later I understood that this is **not how GitHub works for Python files**.

- GitHub does **not** run Python code automatically
- GitHub is mainly used to **store, share, and showcase code**
- Python files need to be run using a **Python interpreter**

HTML/JavaScript files can run in a browser using GitHub Pages, but **Python files cannot run directly from a GitHub link**.

## How to Run This Project

To run this calculator:

1. Make sure **Python** is installed on your system
2. Download this repository or clone it
3. Open a terminal in the project folder
4. Run the file using:

```bash
python .py
